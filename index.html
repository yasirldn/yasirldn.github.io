 <p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am writing to you to express my grave concerns about the recent elections held at the University of Westminster Student Union (UWSU). I strongly believe that these elections were unfair and violated several rules and ethical principles, including spamming members of societies on WhatsApp, votes based on nationalism , pressuring other candidates to step down, teaming up of candidates on the basis of nationalism, excessively large campaign teams on the basis of nationalism , campaigners indulging in unethical behavior, clueless students being approached by these large number of campaigners and given few leaflets and names to vote as they entered the university or when they were having lunch.</p>

<p>Firstly, Candidates should be judged solely on their merit and objectives, not on their nationality or ethnicity. I would like to address the issue of votes being asked on the basis of Indian/Pakistani nationalism. It has been reported that some candidates received votes mainly because of their ethnicity, rather than their actual suitability for the position. This is a clear violation of the principles of fairness and undermines the legitimacy of the elections. Nationalism played a major role in making sure that some of the candidates have excessively large campaign teams and then they also teamed up with other candidates on the basis of nationalism making them invincible. The independent candidates stood no chance of winning against these teams. Many candidates had no chance of getting endorsed from national societies who only endorsed candidates of a particular ethnicity.</p>

<p> Secondly, I would like to highlight the issue of spamming society members on WhatsApp. It has come to my attention that certain candidates in the UWSU elections engaged in spamming societies' members by abusing the contact list on WhatsApp to gain votes. This is a clear violation of the Elections Conduct rule 11.3 which requires the informed consent of the members on the list to use their phone number. By spamming these members of the societies on WhatsApp, these candidates unfairly influenced the votes of the members of those societies, and deprived other candidates of a fair chance to present their ideas and manifestos to these members.</p>

<p> Thirdly, I would like to bring to your attention the issue of pressuring other candidates to step down. It has been reported that intimidation tactics and threats were used to pressure candidates to withdraw from the elections, effectively eliminating competition and ensuring their own victory. This is a clear violation of the rules that prohibit candidates from engaging in any form of harassment or intimidation, and undermines the fundamental principle of democratic elections.</p>

<p>Fourthly, a large majority of students who were clueless about elections have voted not knowing who they voted for and why. The blame goes to the campaigners who pushed these students to vote a few names just by giving them leaflets as they entered their campus and they being nice could not say no. This leaves a huge question mark on the legitimacy of these elections. Many of these voters later said that they would have voted for a different candidate if they were aware of the elections and candidates, and were not approached by these groups of campaigners.</p>

<p>Finally, The excessively large campaign teams meant that independent candidates stood no chance of winning. These teams would tell all the people to vote the same 4,5 names and students who voted had no clue who they voted for. The outcome of the elections was made to be dependent on the number of campaigners rather than how good the candidates and their manifestos were.</p>

<p>As a student I feel enough has not been done to make the elections fair for candidates. I am afraid taking action and changing the rules for next year is not enough. This only means rule breakers will get away with the things and that there is no justice and fairness in the Student Union. I want immediate change and as a student union you need to take our voices seriously.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I strongly believe that the recent UWSU elections were unfair and violated several rules and ethical principles. I urge you to take actions to investigate these issues and hold those responsible accountable for their actions and conduct free and fair re-elections for all the candidates.</p>

<p> Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>

<p>Sincerely</p>
