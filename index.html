 <p>Hi,</p>
<br>
<p>I am writing this to express my grave concerns about the recent elections held at the University of Westminster Students' Union (UWSU). I would like to ask the Students' Union to investigate the unfair and unethical practices of the candidates and their campaigners.
  I would also like to ask UWSU to investigate the unfair endorsements by societies and announce re elections, which are free and fair for all the candidates.
    </p>
<br>

<p>Sincerely</p>

<br>
