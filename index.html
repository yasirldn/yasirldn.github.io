<p>My name is Muhammad Yasir and I&rsquo;m an International student interested in improving the well-being of Students which is why I&rsquo;m running for the position of UWSU VP welfare.</p>
<p>- By not holding a role at SU before, I believe that I can bring positive change by critically analyzing the current issues<br />- I have been a course representative.</p>
<p>My top 5 objectives if elected as VP welfare are:</p>
<p>1. Helping vulnerable students with cost of living and housing crisis. This includes financial aid, scholarships, and <strong>more jobs</strong> in the university</p>
<p>2. Introducing <strong>free coffee/drinks</strong> in study spaces</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Promoting students&rsquo; spiritual well-being, <strong>improving and maintaining prayer spaces</strong>, and introducing bidets</p>
<p>4. Supporting mental, physical, and emotional well being of students through events and free weekly <strong>Pet therapy sessions</strong></p>
<p>5. Reducing <strong>Student Advice and Registry</strong> response time to a minimum while ensuring <strong>same-day appointments and resolutions</strong></p>
<p>The following are further objectives I want to fulfill:<br />&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Option</strong> of being able to attend <strong>lectures online</strong> <br />&bull; Enhancing students&rsquo; employability prospects through <strong>technical interviews</strong> and organizing on-campus job fairs.<br />&bull; Providing a sense of belonging to students through more socializing events including <strong>play for fun sessions</strong><br />&bull; Fighting against any form of discrimination and harassment by creating an inclusive environment on campus.<br />&bull; Keeping students informed and addressing concerns through <strong>regular Q&amp;A</strong> and update sessions as VP</p>
