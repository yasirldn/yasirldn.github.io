<p>My name is Muhammad Yasir and I&rsquo;m an International student interested in improving the well-being of Students which is why I&rsquo;m running for the position of UWSU VP welfare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By not holding a role at SU before, I believe that I can bring positive change by critically analyzing the current issues</p>
<p>&middot;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have been a course representative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My top 5 objectives if elected as VP welfare are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Helping vulnerable students with cost of living and housing crisis in London. This includes financial aid, scholarships, and&nbsp;<strong>more job opportunities</strong> in the university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Reducing Student Advice and Registry response time</strong> to a minimum while ensuring same-day appointments and issue resolutions on campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Introducing free coffee/drinks and snacks in study spaces</strong> in exam/coursework periods to increase students&rsquo; productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Option of being able to attend lectures online &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Supporting mental, physical, and emotional well being of students along with free Pet therapy sessions that run every week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are further objectives I want to fulfill:</p>
<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Promoting students&rsquo; spiritual well-being, improving and maintaining prayer spaces, and introducing bidets</p>
<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Enhancing students&rsquo; employability prospects through&nbsp;<strong>technical interviews</strong> and organizing on-campus job fairs.</p>
<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Providing a sense of belonging to students through more socializing events including&nbsp;<strong>play for fun sessions</strong></p>
<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fighting against any form of discrimination and harassment by creating an inclusive environment on campus.</p>
<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keeping students informed and addressing concerns through regular Q&amp;A and update sessions as VP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
